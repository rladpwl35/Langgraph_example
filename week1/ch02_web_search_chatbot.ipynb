       "   'content': 'An artificial intelligence (AI) agent is a software program that can interact with its environment, collect data, and use that data to perform self-directed tasks that meet predetermined goals. Humans set goals, but an AI agent independently chooses the best actions it needs to perform to achieve those goals. For example, consider a contact center AI agent that wants to resolve customer queries. The agent will automatically ask the customer different questions, look up information in internal [...] For example, in autonomous vehicle fleets, each vehicle acts as an independent agent but collaborates with others to avoid traffic congestion and prevent collisions, leading to smoother traffic flow.\\n\\n## What are the challenges of using AI agents?\\n\\nAI agents are helpful software technologies that automate business workflows to achieve better outcomes. That being said, organizations should address the following concerns when deploying autonomous AI agents for business use cases. [...] For example, cybersecurity agents collect data from third-party databases to remain aware of the latest security incidents.\\n\\n### Rationality\\n\\nAI agents are rational entities with reasoning capabilities. They combine data from their environment with domain knowledge and past context to make informed decisions, achieving optimal performance and results.',\n",
